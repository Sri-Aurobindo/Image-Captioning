# Image-Captioning

## Problem Statement

Visually challenged people will not be able to interpret what is being on show on the screen. In response to the problem our study proposes a model which will be able to extract features from an image and automatically annot them and output it in the form of audio. We will be using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for separate image classification and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for the purpose of caption generation and convert them into audio format.
